*  RTC:  Verify RTC$ config is set.
> config get RTC$
                RTC$ = [0x00003900,0xFFFFFFF3,0x00000033]

*  Capture application close via X

*  Convert heater test to pwm measurements, instead of 100% on/off

*  Turn result window red on failure and green on pass?

*  test h2scan power on / off control, ie heater status

*  Add RS485 test

*  Add specs to SpecTable, keep in app for non db usage.

*  LEAK TEST add leak rate column to display and remove timestamp

*  Hovering over test button pops up description of test, add in line comments

*  help button

*  loop test button

*  When linking H2SCAN or CONTROLLER_BOARD check if linked to a different TM1 and invalidate if found

*  Installer

*  capture spec max / min to database

*  Don't allow multiple instances of running TM1_Controller_test to select the same USB-1208LS

*  Don't allow multiple instances of running TM1_Controller_test's to use the same comports.

*  Save session based on USB-1208LS device.

*  SUB_ASSEMBLY, VER_DATE:  Check drift against controller board start date.
    add set date to database.  set initially by controller board test.  

*  Check tach pump during thermals testing * cnts per sec.




DONE
*  Add test retry

*  Add Assembly level, don't show test buttons or enable start button until assembly level selected.

*  Add TMCOM1 test once working

*  Verify entries fields based on what tests are enabled.

*  Add enable all / disable all tests

*  Add 4/20 test once 4/20 working

*  Getting config fails when run after reboot.

*  Test_THERMAL not stopping data logging on failure.

*  Add config defaults set / verification ( after power cycle )

*  Add USB thumb drive test ( test during h2scan update )

*  Capture leak and heater data tables to network location

*  Copy sensor fw file to thumb drive.

*  Verify files exported from TM1 to thumb drive.

*  Sub assembly:  H2SCAN, verify status 8001 and pcbsensor matches analogbd temp.

*  Add 1856D com port to entry check

*  Verify TMCOM1 & 1856 com ports unique when entered.

*  Refresh com port select box with updated serial port list.

*  Validate TM1 SN format
   MMMNNFFYYWWNNNN
   MMM = TM1
   NN configuration (01)
   FF mfg code (01= BPLG Beaverton)
   YYWW year, ww
   NNNN uniuqe serial #

*  TM1 sub assembly:  If can't find FTDI with TM1_SN use board SN.

*  Program board SN in config when fw bug fix in place.  Check board serial # during sub-assembly
   Only program board.serial_number if controller board test has passed in production or service modes.

*  create link table
	At controller board test:  board SN written to config.
	At sub assembly test:  board SN & H2SCAN SN linked in db to TM1 SN.	
	
*  Add data logging, with option to disable for case where test run at CM without SQL server 

*  Add spec differntiate for usage ie AUX1, AUX2

*  Log test details on failure, ie Gen3DC

*  Validate Controller Board Serial Number on entry during sub assembly test.

*  Not able to find USB com port on first boot of new FTDI

*  Test_BOOT:   When the test is run the 2nd time it re-uses the SerialPort because is not nothing, set to nothing when test completes?

*  GetPwmStatus, return false if all items not found or retry

*  GetTecStatus,  return false if all items not found for both tec's or retry.

*  Add date/time verification after power cycle

*  Resolve intermittent USB serial port issue, have added resetting of port after locating with ftdi lib and
   then wait 10s to open

*  Not able to find device programming FDTI SN for the 1st time.

*  Recall prev COM port selections.

*  Add versioning

*  check prev test (prod mode)

*  Disable combo box scrolling

*  Add SN to popup title bars to identify uut.

*  color code app border or body and pop up based on usb-1208 selection.

*  Center pop ups above uut app.

*  Add SN to popup title bars to identify uut.

*  color code app border or body and pop up based on usb-1208 selection.

*  display comport on form

*  Center pop ups above uut app.
